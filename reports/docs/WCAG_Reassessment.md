# WCAG 2.1 & 2.2 AA Reassessment

This document summarizes the most recent review of the Integra SeniorCare website with respect to WCAG 2.1 AA and WCAG 2.2 AA requirements.

## Current Compliance Status

- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: The automated tests documented in `ACCESSIBILITY_TEST_RESULTS.md` report **0 accessibility violations** using `axe-core` and Puppeteer. These results indicate full compliance with the success criteria implemented during Phase 2.
- **WCAG 2.2 AA**: Phase 5 introduced a `touchSize` prop for the `Icon` component and applies it to social media links in the header and footer. Icons now provide at least a 44×44 px touch target, addressing success criterion **2.5.8 Target Size**.

## Review of Prior Audit Findings

An earlier audit flagged three main issues:

1. **Links without discernible text** – The current code assigns `aria-label` attributes to icon-only links via the `Icon` component, ensuring each has an accessible name.
2. **Select element missing an accessible name** – `ContactForm.astro` uses a `<label for="contact-subject">` element and ARIA attributes to provide a clear accessible name.
3. **Touch targets smaller than 24 px** – Resolved with the `touchSize` prop, giving each icon a minimum touch area of 44×44 px.

These issues appear addressed in the repository and are likely the result of testing an earlier version or a tooling error.

## Recommendations

- **Full WCAG 2.2 Audit:** Run updated automated tests that include WCAG 2.2 checks to confirm there are no remaining issues beyond criterion 2.5.8.
- **Manual Screen‑Reader Testing:** Complement automated results with manual tests using NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to ensure robust accessibility.
- **EN 301 549 Considerations:** If compliance with the European standard is required, verify additional multimedia and documentation requirements as summarized in `Improve_Legal_Accessibility.md`.

## Conclusion

Based on the current codebase and documented test results, the site meets WCAG 2.1 AA and has begun addressing WCAG 2.2 AA with larger touch targets. Further testing is recommended to validate complete WCAG 2.2 conformance and to ensure alignment with EN 301 549.
