# Phase 5: WCAG 2.2 Accessibility Enhancements

**Date:** June 4, 2025

This phase introduces adjustments required for compliance with WCAG 2.2 AA, specifically success criterion **2.5.8 Target Size**. Social media icons now provide a sufficiently large touch target on mobile and desktop.

## Key Updates

1. **Icon Component (`Icon.astro`)**
   - Added a new `touchSize` prop to apply `w-touch-*` and `h-touch-*` utility classes.
   - When supplied, links and spans within the component include flexible width and height to meet minimum touch target recommendations.

2. **Header and Footer**
   - Social media icons now pass `touchSize="sm"` to ensure at least a 44×44 px interactive area.
   - This improves usability on touch devices and addresses prior audit warnings about insufficient target size.

## Outcome

All interactive icon links provide a minimum touch area of 44×44 px, satisfying WCAG 2.2 criterion **2.5.8** and improving overall mobile accessibility.
