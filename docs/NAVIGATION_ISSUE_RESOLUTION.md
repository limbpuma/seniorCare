# ✅ Navigation Issue Resolution - COMPLETED

**Date**: June 4, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Implementation**: Path 1 (Multi-page Recovery)  
**Time**: 1.5 hours  

## 🎯 Issue Resolution Summary

### **Root Cause Identified:**
The navigation was **hidden due to CSS class conflicts**. The desktop navigation menu had the `hidden` class applied by default, which was preventing it from being visible even on desktop screens.

### **Primary Issue:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE (Broken) -->
<div class="items-center justify-between hidden w-full md:flex md:w-auto md:order-1">
  <Nav links={NAVIGATION} />
</div>
```

The `hidden` class was taking precedence over `md:flex`, causing the navigation to remain invisible on all screen sizes.

### **Secondary Issues:**
1. **JavaScript conflicts** between Flowbite library and custom navigation code
2. **Responsive behavior** not properly handling screen size changes
3. **Mobile menu toggle** not coordinating with desktop navigation state
